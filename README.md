# hello-world
My first GitHub repository

What up!
My name is Ricky Reyes. I'm an aspiring web developer who hopes to build beautiful and useful applications and websites soon. I'm currently learning HTML & CSS from a book called Murach's HTML5 and CSS3. I look forward to completing challenges from the website called FrontEnd Mentor. That's all for now. Cheers!
